  b) The treatment is directed by a qualified licensed physical therapist.
  c) The patient demonstrates measurable functional improvement between sessions as documented by objective standardized outcome measures.
  d) The treatment plan includes specific, achievable, and time-limited goals tied to functional outcomes.

4. BENEFIT LIMITS AND EXCEPTIONS

Standard Plans: Coverage is limited to 12 sessions per calendar year for outpatient physical therapy.

Premium Plans: Coverage is limited to 24 sessions per calendar year.

EXCEPTION CRITERIA — Medical Necessity Override:
Coverage beyond the standard session limit may be approved when ALL of the following are documented:

  i)   The treating provider submits clinical documentation demonstrating significant, measurable functional improvement (minimum 20% improvement on a validated outcome measure such as FOTO, Oswestry Disability Index, or similar).
  ii)  A physician letter of medical necessity is provided attesting that continued PT is clinically indicated and that goals have not yet been achieved.
  iii) The treatment plan has been updated to reflect current functional status, revised goals, and estimated sessions required to achieve maximum medical improvement.
  iv)  There is no evidence that the patient has plateaued; objective progress must be documented in clinical notes for each session.

5. SESSION COUNT METHODOLOGY

Sessions are counted per calendar year (January 1 – December 31). Sessions authorized or provided by any in-network or out-of-network provider for the same benefit category count toward the annual limit. Members or providers may request a session count audit by submitting a written request to the Claims Department.

  - Complete PT progress notes for all treatment sessions within the benefit year
  - Initial evaluation with baseline functional measurements
  - Updated evaluation with current functional measurements using standardized tools
  - Physician attestation of medical necessity

7. REGULATORY COMPLIANCE

This policy is designed to comply with applicable state and federal parity laws. Members who believe a denial violates mental health parity or other federal requirements should contact the Plan's Compliance Department.
